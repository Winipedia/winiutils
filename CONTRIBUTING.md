Contributions aren't limited to code — reporting bugs, improving
documentation, and answering questions are just as valuable. Before
opening a new issue, search [existing issues](https://github.com/Winipedia/winiutils/issues)
to avoid duplicates.

- **Bugs** — describe what you expected, what happened instead, and the
  steps to reproduce it.
- **Features** — describe the problem before proposing a solution, and
  open an issue before starting a large pull request so the approach can
  be discussed first.
- **Questions** — open an issue if nothing else already answers it.
